# Woopy Learning Developed by Kotlin

This project was to create a preschool mobile application for kids to learn about animals. This application aims to engage kids in learning activities through the educational app which is a new way of learning to the kids in this era instead of learning from books. We name the app “Woopy Learning”. We created this app with colourful and some simple animation in order to attract the kids to interact with fun. It is easy to interact with only several buttons that help kids to learn animal knowledge on the go using smartphones. Furthermore, this app is focusing on the importance of attracting children's attention towards learning by implementing sound from various sources, attractive pictures, and colors.
